# [ PROXIFIER] 🎯


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Glitches]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Fathima Abdullah] - [ NSS COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING, Palakkad]
- Member 2: [Aleena K R] - [NSS COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING, Palakkad]


### Project Description
[Proxifier is a brilliantly entertaining web-based tool that takes attendance for you — even when you’re not in your the classroom. By playing a pre-recorded audio of your roll number at the perfect time, Proxifier ensures your absence is as unnoticed as possible… at least until the teacher starts asking questions.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[We’ve all been there — sick at home, stuck in traffic, or just enjoying a peaceful nap — and suddenly realizing…
“Oh no! They’re calling attendance right now!”
Missing class is one thing, but missing the glory of hearing your name echoed across the room? That’s heartbreak in HD. The problem? There’s absolutely no existing tool to satisfy this utterly pointless yet emotionally satisfying need… until now.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[Enter Proxifier — your personal proxy voice for roll call domination.
- Record once, relax forever: Capture your “attendance voice” in style — cheerful, sleepy, or sarcastic.
- Choose 'play' ,let Proxifier delivers it to the roll call like a true stand-in superstar.
- Play on demand: Anyone on the class dashboard can trigger your audio at the right time.

*Upon visiting the website, a user is presented with a homepage offering two primary paths: 
creating a new account or logging in. A new user choosing to create an account is first directed to a page to register with their email and password.
After submitting, they are guided to an audio upload page to complete their profile by uploading an attendance audio file, which is then saved. 
Once this process is complete, the user is returned to the homepage. For existing users, selecting "Login" leads to a page where they enter their credentials. 
Successful authentication grants them access to the main Attendance Table Page, where they can view a detailed student table and play the corresponding attendance 
audio for each entry. A user can end their session from the dashboard by logging out, or at any point by simply closing the website.*
